The research paper investigates the potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as an alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) tasks, particularly within the domain of robotics. SNNs, inspired by the mammalian brain, utilize spiking neurons characterized by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to offer advantages in temporal dynamics and low latency, making them suitable for real-time applications. The study introduces a novel framework, SpikeGym, designed to facilitate the training of SNNs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within Nvidia's Isaac Gym simulator, significantly reducing training times and enabling extensive exploration of SNN configurations.

The research aims to: (i) explore various SNN configurations for DRL robotic tasks, (ii) compare SNNs and ANNs across different network configurations, and (iii) apply the optimal SNN topology to the Ant-v4 benchmark in the MuJoCo simulator, achieving performance improvements over existing SNN implementations. The study highlights that while SNNs can perform complex tasks, they encounter challenges with deeper architectures, which limits their performance compared to ANNs in tasks requiring more layers.

Methodologically, the paper employs direct training methods using surrogate gradients to address the non-differentiable nature of spikes, leveraging the on-policy PPO algorithm to exploit SNNs' temporal correlation capabilities. SpikeGym integrates with the skrl library to utilize GPU acceleration, supporting environments like Cartpole and Ant in Isaac Gym and Ant-v4 in MuJoCo. The framework handles temporal observations and SNN-specific data, such as spike traces and membrane voltage, facilitating efficient SNN training and allowing for extensive exploration of network architectures and hyperparameters.

Key findings include:

1. **Performance Comparison:** SNNs demonstrate stable performance with fewer layers, particularly in simpler tasks like Cartpole and Multimodal Tracking. However, in complex tasks like Ant, ANNs outperform SNNs, especially with deeper networks. SNNs achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters due to the expressiveness of spiking neurons.

2. **Training Efficiency:** SpikeGym significantly accelerates training, reducing time from hours to minutes compared to existing SNN training frameworks, enabling robust experimentation.

3. **Generalization and Stability:** SNNs exhibit less overfitting compared to ANNs, maintaining stable performance across different architectures and excelling in tasks requiring temporal processing.

The study identifies a key issue with the surrogate gradient function, which leads to increased inaccuracies as the depth of SNNs increases. This, alongside coding strategies for effectively feeding information to SNNs, is earmarked for future research. Despite these challenges, SNNs outperform ANNs in simpler tasks like Cartpole, attributed to the greater expressiveness of spiking neurons. The research applied these insights to the Ant-v4 task, achieving results surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms by a factor of 4.4.

The paper emphasizes the availability of datasets and code in the SpikeGym repository, facilitating further research and replication. The authors declare no competing interests and highlight the open-access nature of the publication, encouraging non-commercial use and distribution with appropriate credit. Overall, the study underscores the potential of SNNs in DRL tasks and identifies areas for improvement in training methodologies and network architectures, encouraging further exploration in neuromorphic computing applications.
