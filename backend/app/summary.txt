The research paper investigates the application of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for robotic tasks, emphasizing their potential to mimic the mammalian brain more closely than traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). SNNs utilize spiking neurons governed by ordinary differential equations, which facilitate asynchronous communication and are particularly promising for tasks involving temporal complexity.

The study introduces a novel framework, SpikeGym, designed to enhance the training efficiency of SNNs in DRL tasks. SpikeGym integrates with Nvidia's Isaac Gym and MuJoCo simulators, incorporating modules for spiking neuron implementations and temporal observation handling. This framework significantly accelerates training, reducing time from hours to minutes compared to state-of-the-art tools.

The research focuses on applying SNNs with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in environments such as Cartpole and Ant. The methodology involves configuring both SNNs and ANNs with a shared feature extractor and separate output heads for actions and state value predictions, allowing for a direct performance comparison. YAML files are used to specify network architectures, facilitating easy experimentation with different configurations.

Key findings indicate that SNNs perform well in simpler tasks like Cartpole and Multimodal Tracking, especially with shallow network architectures. However, in more complex tasks like Ant, ANNs outperform SNNs, particularly when deeper network layers are utilized. The study attributes the performance limitations of deeper SNNs to the surrogate gradient function, which may introduce inaccuracies as network depth increases.

Despite these challenges, SNNs demonstrated stability and efficiency with fewer layers, while ANNs showed higher performance variability and a tendency to overfit with smaller parameter counts. In the Ant-v4 task, SpikeGym's SNN-PPO network achieved rewards surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly with a single-layer configuration.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the potential of SNNs in DRL, particularly in scenarios where energy efficiency and expressiveness are critical. It highlights the need for further research to enhance the expressiveness and training efficiency of SNNs, especially in complex environments. The authors provide open access to the datasets and code used in the study, encouraging further exploration and development in this promising area of research.
