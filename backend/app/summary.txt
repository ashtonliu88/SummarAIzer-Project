The research paper investigates the potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) tasks, positioning them as a promising third-generation neural network model that mimics mammalian brain functionality. The study introduces a novel framework, SpikeGym, designed to train SNNs using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm within Nvidia's Isaac Gym simulator, significantly accelerating training times compared to existing tools.

**Research Objectives and Methodology:**
The primary objectives are to explore various SNN configurations for DRL tasks, compare their performance against traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and apply the optimal SNN topology to the Ant-v4 benchmark in the MuJoCo simulator. The SpikeGym framework integrates GPU acceleration for faster training and includes several components:
1. **Neurons Module:** Implements spiking neurons with surrogate functions like Rectangular, Gaussian, and Sigmoid.
2. **Wrappers:** Modifies existing wrappers to handle temporal dimensions, aligning with SNNs' temporal nature.
3. **Network Classes:** Provides BaseSNN and ANN classes for creating networks from YAML files, enabling direct performance comparisons.
4. **SNN-PPO Architecture:** Utilizes a shared Feed-Forward structure with a feature extractor and output heads, employing a variation of the LCC algorithm for input processing.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Training Acceleration:** SpikeGym reduces training time from over 3 hours to approximately 7 minutes.
2. **Performance Comparison:**
   - In simpler tasks like Cartpole, SNNs demonstrated more stable performance with fewer parameters and layers, while ANNs tended to overfit.
   - In complex tasks like Ant, ANNs outperformed SNNs, particularly with deeper networks.
   - SNNs excelled in Multimodal Tracking tasks with simpler architectures, highlighting their effectiveness in temporal tasks.
3. **Benchmark Performance:** SpikeGym's SNN-PPO networks surpassed the PopSAN network in the Ant-v4 task, achieving significantly higher rewards with a one-layer configuration.

**Conclusions and Future Directions:**
The study concludes that SNNs can be competitive with ANNs in specific RL tasks, especially when using shallow architectures. However, challenges remain in leveraging deeper layers effectively due to potential inaccuracies linked to the surrogate gradient function used in SNNs. Future research will focus on addressing these challenges and developing effective coding strategies for SNNs.

The research underscores the potential of SNNs in reinforcement learning, emphasizing efficiency and performance.
